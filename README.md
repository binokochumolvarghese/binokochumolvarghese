## Hi, I'm Bino⚡

I'm a software developer from India, who is passionate about the Web platform and love creating things for the Web. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and more than a decade of experience in web technologies.

When I’m not coding, I like reading books, blogs, and notes on various topics that interest me. I also sometimes write poetry and stories in Malayalam, the language spoken in Kerala, India. I have a strong curiosity to explore the world and love traveling.
